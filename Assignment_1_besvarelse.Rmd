## Introduction

## Litterature

**Replicability**
Being able to replicate research results by other researchers is one
important part of the methodology in science. In the past, there has been little
testing of replicability. Reasons for this are that it is not promoted to
replicate another researcher's work. Criticism can also arise about
lack of creativity and imagination. A critical question is also asked
to the integrity of the researcher as one can be interpreted as critical to
the findings or that one does not trust the researcher. Such arguments
makes it less attractive to conduct replication studies.

Dewald and co tried to replicate a number of datasets and they found that
accidental errors in empirical articles are rather common than unusual
[@dewald1986]. Although it is quite common for errors to occur in empirical
economic research, it is quite frustrating and difficult to replicate
and build on the research when there are many errors in the dataset and that
also does not appear to significantly affect the conclusion of the authors.

In recent times, technology has made it easier, cheaper and more effecient to make and maintain journal archives. Still, @mccullough2008 has in the article
"Do Economics Journal Archives Promote Replicable Research?" shown findings
that the potential offer is reduced when editors fail to
enforce and authors do not adhere to the guidelines of the journal archives.
It is noted that few researchers use the opportunity as
offered to engage in replication because economic profession is considering
replication as an ideal to be known but not to be practiced
[@mccullough2008].

##Possible soulutions
**Compendium and "Code Chunks"**
[@gentleman2007] points out that compendium is an important tool for integrating codes and data etc. This is because when such tools are collected and assembled it must be possible to distribute and update, given that the compendium is of the right quality, so will the possibility of reproduction be simple.

Another possible solution is "Code Chunks" or "Text Chunks". Code and text chunks are a tool used to display data and code for illustrations. Text chunks are used to describe and interpret results and codes. Dynamic document will therefore be an optimal compendium since all the data and components will be available for reproducibility [@gentleman2007].

##Analysis

##conclusion
By using dynamic documents in the form of codes, data, explanations, etc. in the form of code chunks and text chunks, there are good opportunities for both replication and reproducibility of research, and also further research on previous studies.
- Motivate researchers to share to make their work available
- Disadvantage? maybe too many different packages (difficult to keep track)
