-   Nice touch using multiple .bib files. An alternative is one online library at Zotero
-   I have changed the title
-   I have changed the level of the headings. We should start at level 1. Remember that we code structure, not appearance (we can change the appearance later if need be)
-   Check out inline cite (i.e. cite command without the square brackets). I think the text becomes more fluent this way
-   Quite an exciting git history. I am not sure all the excitement was intended, but well done.
